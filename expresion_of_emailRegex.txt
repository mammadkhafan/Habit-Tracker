Let's break down the pattern:

1. `^` - Matches the start of the string.

2. `[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+` - Matches one or more occurrences of any alphabetic character (both lowercase and uppercase), digits, underscore, plus, ampersand, asterisk, or hyphen.
 	This part matches the local part of the email before the '@' symbol.

3. `(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+)*` - Matches zero or more occurrences of a dot followed by one or more occurrences of any alphabetic character (both lowercase and uppercase)
	digits, underscore, plus, ampersand, asterisk, or hyphen. This part allows for multiple dots in the local part of the email, which is common in some email addresses.

4. `@` - Matches the '@' symbol.
5. `(?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.)+` - Matches one or more occurrences of one or more alphabetic characters (both lowercase and uppercase)
	digits, or hyphens followed by a dot. This part matches the domain name, allowing for subdomains.

6. `[a-zA-Z]{2,7}` - Matches two to seven occurrences of any alphabetic character (both lowercase and uppercase).
 	This part matches the top-level domain (TLD) like ".com", ".org", etc.

7. `$` - Matches the end of the string.
